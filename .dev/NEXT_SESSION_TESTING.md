# NEXT SESSION - CRITICAL TESTING REQUIRED

## Issue: Unresponsive Preferences Window
**Status:** Debug build ready, awaiting testing
**Priority:** HIGH - Core functionality broken

## Current State
- wispr-lite is running with debug instrumentation
- Changes are UNCOMMITTED
- User deferred testing to focus on other work

## Test Procedure (Start of Next Session)

### 1. Open Preferences
```bash
# Verify wispr-lite is running
pgrep -f wispr-lite

# Click tray icon → "Preferences"
```

### 2. Interact with Window
- Try clicking anywhere in the window
- Try pressing ESC key
- Try clicking the X (close button)
- Note what happens (or doesn't happen)

### 3. Check Debug Logs
```bash
tail -50 ~/.local/state/wispr-lite/logs/wispr-lite.log
```

**Look for:**
- "Opening preferences window"
- "PreferencesWindow realized"
- "PreferencesWindow shown"
- "PreferencesWindow mapped"
- "PreferencesWindow button press at (x, y)" ← KEY DIAGNOSTIC
- "PreferencesWindow key press: <keycode>"

### 4. Diagnosis

**If you see button/key press events in logs:**
→ Events ARE reaching window, but widgets aren't responding
→ Root cause: Widget layout or rendering issue
→ Next step: Investigate widget creation in preferences.py

**If you DON'T see button/key press events:**
→ Events are NOT reaching window
→ Root cause: Window focus, input grab, or window manager issue
→ Next step: Investigate window creation, focus, or Cinnamon settings

### 5. Fallback Plan
If debugging doesn't reveal root cause:
- Revert all changes: `git restore wispr_lite/ui/preferences.py wispr_lite/app.py`
- Consider alternative: Edit config.yaml directly instead of GUI
- Document as known issue

## Files Modified (Uncommitted)
- wispr_lite/ui/preferences.py (+46 lines)
- wispr_lite/app.py (+3 lines)

## Commit When Ready
If fix is successful:
```bash
git add wispr_lite/ui/preferences.py wispr_lite/app.py
git commit -m "fix: Make preferences window responsive with event debugging

Preferences window was completely unresponsive - couldn't click or close.
Added event handlers and logging to diagnose and fix:
- Explicit event masks for input events
- present() to ensure focus
- ESC key handler as failsafe
- Comprehensive event logging

Fixes #<issue-number>"
```

If unsuccessful:
```bash
git restore wispr_lite/ui/preferences.py wispr_lite/app.py
```
